          This EP is amazing !!❤️ I think it includes many styles. I got that Avril Lavigne vibe in “Sink again, Rise again, and the J-pop style in others. Overall, I think it’s an EP merging different styles and techniques. You really did an amazing job as a singer💜💜💜(also a Vgamer😆)

          I am so surprised of the EP that actually has a story when IRyS explained it and the story is really interesting looking at how Hope fell to despair and gain back Hope but stronger. Personally I really like the song "Nameless Sadness", which the title itself cannot describe the kind of sadness when you find out the truth is not what you see, and start to have doubt to what you believe. The lyrics is strong enough but IRyS singing bringing it out even stronger feeling, it makes me goosebumps whenever I listen to this song.

          This is the first EP I bought in my life. It's really heartbreaking to see IRyS works hard and even a throat injury. I hope to try my best to let the little princess know that IRyStocrats support her very much and look forward to her growth in the future.

          I really like the order of the songs throughout the album. When listening in order, each song seems to tell the journey of IRyS, and is also very much like the opening song and ending song of an anime.

          Hi, IRyS. When I first listened to the album “Journey”, my first thought was - perfect. I have to say that this is the first time in my life that I bought a record to support a singer because I was moved. I hope you can create more works, but please don't be under pressure. Health is the most important thing, whether it is mental or physical.

          It is packed with emotions from IRyS as she descends to our realm and experiences the World, full of majestic wonders and angelic splendors but also filled with evil maliciousness and deep darkness from the human soul. But even when she is filled with sadness, despair and anger at this world, she also sees the small little light of Hope that lingers on. Sheltering that little spark of Hope, weathering the storm of human emotions to finally emerge on the other side triumphantly, understanding that despite all our flaws and scars, we all have the potential to bring Hope to the world with our words and actions, those buds hiding deep within, ready to flower forth in its beauty and splendor as we show kindness and love to everyone.

          About "Nameless Sadness", I like the feeling of this slightly angry roar, and the arrangement of the spoken parts highlights this feeling even more. The melody is paired with IRyS's voice, making people immersed in it.

          I knew u hurt your vocal cords while recording journey, I can tell that u really put all your heart into this EP. U did a really great job in it, tried to perform every line flawlessly. IRyS never let all IRyStrocats down, all songs in journey are all bangers. The whole EP exactly is the journey of a nephilim, who was so confident to spend hope to other find out that the reality is full of despair people lose faith in things easily, so she started to questioning herself and struggled if she should continue spend hope or juz give up, at the end nephilim choose to continue bring hope to other. Although there may be a host of barriers and difficulties, hope is a really important element in everyone's life, so never losing hope to anything. IRyS will always be here as long as we have hope in our heart. U are my push forever, looking forward to your future plans. IRyStrocats will always be with you! Stay happy stay healthy, I wish u all the best.

          Thank you for such a masterpiece, the texture of everything is superb. By the way the key ring is really beautiful, it’s now hanging on my desk lamp and shines every day. Looking forward to the birthday set. Here's wishing you a happy first anniversary, I may not be able to come( but I won’t forget to buy the Merch), because I'm going to prepare for my graduated school test. Love you forever.

          I loved Journey as a whole, from the music, lyrics, vocals, instrumentals, and the story in potrays. It shows how IRyS as "hope" sees the world and explores it from the surface to the core, and even after seeing all the bad things, she still accepts it and is willing to save it. Also all the songs are straight up BANGERS!

The lyrics of several of them are similar to my life, IRyS voice matched the song perfectly with these lyrics!

          When I start playing the EP “Journey”, what I feel first is energy and passion, then it turns to the fragile and melancholy. Then the light and full hope voice brings me to life. All the tracks on this EP are perfect! I can easily see the sight and story when hearing them and feel what IRyS experienced in the Journey. Among them, my favorite song is “Nameless Sadness”. I have never had music do what “Nameless Sadness” did to me. This literally brought me to tears. It is mind blowing and makes me speechless.... A song alone has never made me bawl my eyes out like a child just out of pure beauty and power alone. No matter how many times I hear it. The goosebumps, the heart in throat sensation then the tears start pouring...It's impossible to dislike such a masterpiece. I can't even explain this in words. Ugh. I just love “Nameless Sadness”.

          I absolutely love it. I remember the day it was revealed and how I couldn't wait for the release date. I learned about IRyS at around her fifth month past debut, so I was a bit late to the Caesura of Despair hypetrain; with that being said, knowing that Journey was an amazing continuation of IRyS' discography makes me so excited for what's to come next. Love everything you do, IRyS, and thank you IRyStocrats for being so driven to show our gratitude for what IRyS has done for the hololive community.

          Journey is definitely an amazing EP with IRyS showing her capability to sing songs of various genres and styles well. Love Nameless Sadness the most in the EP, IRyS really expresses the emotions from the song with her beautiful singing, which makes it still one of my top 5 IRyS originals after months. The rest songs from the EP are well made and would always stay in my playlist. Thank you IRyS for all the hard work and keep creating high quality works!

          Happy AnniversaRyS.🥳🥳🥳I like how you being PonRyS and YabaiRyS. Your demon side is so cute for me. But every time when I listen to your songs. I will be like "OMG IRyS really is an angel😇🙏”. I really like how you express the emotions in “Journey”. Especially "flower of the hope”. Sometimes I may want to cry when I listen to it.🤣 I can't wait to see you on the stage!! I wish everything around you will get better and better!! I will always keep HOPE in my mind.😆

          HIRys. Your songs are really really awesome. In this EP, my favorite song is "Joy with you".This song is full of power, full of hope. Just like you. Others in "Journey" , and "Quarter Bravery" or all the original songs  also worth savoring. We love you. Thanks for your descending. All the IRyStocrats will be with you till HOPE spreads all over the world.

          HIRyS~2nd EP 「Journey」 リリースおめでとうございます！！！レコードVer.買いました～　初めて実物を見たとき、「うわぁ、きれい！Yabeeeee ! ! 」と思いました。このアルバムの中で一番好きな曲は「Only in Hope」です。アイリスちゃんのポジティブな気持ちと優しい思いを感じます。そして清楚?な歌声と相まって、本当に私を希望に満ち溢れています。そのおかげで毎日頑張ることができました。私の英語は下手ですから(台湾人です)、配信の内容が時々わからないです。それでも毎回の配信が楽しみで仕方がありません！これからもずっと応援しています。体調には気をつけてくださいね~

          I love this EP, but my personal favorite song is “Joy With You”. Because I like it when IRyS sings upbeat songs. Only In Hope is a close second.

          I like the atmosphere created by this ED "Journey" very much, and the track is also like what IRyS said in the live broadcast before, Giving people a very "epic" feeling. I like to listen to any songs sung by IRyS very much. During my homework or any leisure time, I will open the exclusive IRyS playlist and listen to IRyS songs. I like this ED very much. I placed an order immediately. Through this ED, I felt IRyS' understanding and control over sound. I was amazed. I like IRyS very much and will continue to like it later. I will continue to support you. ❤❤❤

          Because of your heavenly voice, your efforts, and your hard work, we can enjoy this wonderful EP. All the songs in this EP are great, but I choose "Joy with You" as my favorite because of the feeling of it like an adventure anime op song and I really like the lyric "I feel I wanna join with you, join with you and share more joy with you". Take your time! There are many things waiting for you to see and feel on your "Journey"! Enjoy it!

          The Journey EP really surprised me the first time I heard it. Each song has a different feeling and tells the story of IRyS. After descending she feels confident and hopeful about herself and humanity; Thinking the world is a pure place. She then struggles and becomes confused when finding out that humans can be evil and cruel. IRyS matures a bit and regains confidence. She accepts both sides of humanity and wishes for a hopeful future with them. I love the concept of this EP! IRyS goes through some character development and her beautiful singing expresses her thoughts and feelings so well! All six songs are bangers! I like Flower of Hope the most because of it's message and how soft IRyS's voice sounds.

          I love this EP since it showcases how IRyS has an amazing voice that fits numerous musical styles, from heavy and upbeat Rock to slower and more emotional ballads. All 6 songs on the Journey are great, but my favorite is for sure Joy With You because it has a really good guitar melody and a heavy Rock sound that I enjoy, but also a catchy vocal melody in the chorus with positive lyrics about spreading joy and happiness with others and looking forward to the future. It is a great song that I keep finding myself coming back to listen to repeatedly, as well as Only In Hope which is also a catchy and upbeat Rock song, and Flower of Hope which is an incredibly beautiful and emotional ballad with powerful vocals that is a great way to close the EP. I also really like the concept of Journey as a storyline of IRyS arriving to bring hope to the people, but in the process discovering the dark side of humanity and its cruelty and being unsure of what to do or if humanity is worth the effort to save, but ultimately deciding that it is worth it and finds the beauty in humanity despite the darkness. Overall, this is a great EP that I absolutely love and was extremely happy to get my physical copy for, and I hope to do the same with future releases from IRyS!

          I really like the way that you convey the emotion in every song, especially in Nameless Sadness, it definitely is my favorite one in this EP. From Only In Hope to Flower of Hope, when you listen to these songs, it feels like you're watching the entire movie called <The Journey of Hope>.

          Love you IRyS! You are always the HOPE in our heart! I just love how much energy been poured into this Journey EP. Specially in Nameless Sadness really gives the frustration and powerless vibe. Then Flower of Hope gives us the hope energy we all need. Journey really builds a world itself with abundant of emotions from you IRyS yet there will always be HOPE in the end of the Journey!

          After her incredible first EP I was hyped to see what was next, cuz I was sure that it will be amazing, and I wasn’t wrong. Not only for the LORE, but every song has a very emotional significance about IRyS and what she want to show us with her beautiful voice. I’m happy for everything she has done, I will supporting and cheering for her.

          The thing I love most about this EP is how IRyS sings each and every song, conveying the emotion of the lyrics and tunes so well❤️ And the lyrics of every song, especially Nameless Sadness, is really deep and meaningful and just resonates with me and how I feel about the world and the different things. It is an EP where I won't ever feel like skipping any of the tracks and no amount of looping will make me sick of the songs! I love Journey and I am grateful and proud of IRyS for, once again, producing such wonderful work and music. A real gift to IRyStocrats and everyone listing to the album💎❤️

          HIRyS! It’s Huai! This is my first time buying an album. First of all, my favorite song in the album is definitely “Nameless Sadness”, the emotion it convey is very sorrowful but epic. Your powerful voice in this song really makes it even better! Whether it is the mix or the design of the song are awesome. Btw do we have the chance to hear you sing songs from《Journey》in streams xD?

          In this EP, I followed IRyS’s journey when she travel through the world. Although she saw the cruelty and dark side of this world, she still decided to accept and give hope to it. This made me believe that even I were suffering my life, hope will definitely come to me as long as I sustain. The expression of emotions in every song are really nice, going with the musics very perfectly. Overall, I really like this EP. Thank you IRyS for making the amazing EP! Looking forward to your future work, I’m prepared to be amazed!

          I think Journey was the perfect EP to discover IRyS' true nature as a nephilim. We follow her through her journey of discovery of humanity, her wonder at first contact, her sadness after discovering our dark side, but also the hope and beauty that lies within human life.

          In the beginning, "Nameless sadness" was my favorite in this EP. Maybe it's because I'm a pessimistic person. This kind of music is always touching my heart. However, "Joy with you" gradually took over the first place as time went by. The lyrics, "I feel I wanna join with you...share more joy with you...", keep repeating in my mind. Yes, I wanna share more joy with you, IRyS. I can't stop thinking about this. You light up hope in my life. Let me know no matter how cruel the world is, I can still find joy somewhere, especially with you. So, let's explore more joy and share together in our long future journey. ヾ( ˶ˆ꒳ˆ˵)ノ ̑̑💎💕

          I'm still amazed by the amount of songs contented in this EP. There are 6 in it ! That's enough amount to be called as a full album to me. While the first EP has 3, it literally double in this one. Wow, just wow. And that's not it. As the title says "Journey" this is an story about how IRyS's character build-up and her emotion changes after debut, and I definitely can sense it through these songs after listen to it by order. When "Only in Hope" is the Intro, it definitely gave me the punch, kind of like an injection of adrenaline. And yes THIS IS THE HOPE we need ! While "Joy with Me" maybe the most touched to me in all of the songs. It really share the joy. It almost seems like I can feel the joy that IRyS's passion about streaming and appreciation of the interact with her community. "Nameless Sadness" is a sad song, I appreciated that IRyS is putting huge amount of emotion into it and it really touches me. "Bare your teeth" to me is kind of sings out the struggle of life. When in life, sometimes things just happened, and we can't do shitake about it. This songs perfectly catches it, also I'm super in love with the chorus, it's so catchy to me ! This album amazed me so much that once I heard it streaming on the site, I decided to brought it with no hesitate. To appreciated all the hard work IRyS put in, this is at least I can do.

          Journey Congratulations on the release! My favorite song is Nameless Sadness, even though it is a sad song. I can feel the feeling of helplessness in the song, and it is the song that touches me the most. I hope your song will touch more people's hearts, just like your coming in the first place. Also I wish you all the best for the future.
